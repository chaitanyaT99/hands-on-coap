# CoAP
## RFC 7252 Constrained Application Protocol
The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained networks in the Internet of Things. The protocol is designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.

## What CoAP is
- A very efficient RESTful protocol
- Ideal for constrained devices and networks
- Specialized for M2M applications
- Easy to proxy to/from HTTP 

## What CoAP is not
- A general replacement for HTTP
- HTTP compression
- Restricted to isolated “automation” networks
 
## CoAP Features
- Embedded web transfer protocol (coap://)
- Asynchronous transaction model
- UDP binding with reliability and multicast support
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods
- URI support
- Small, simple 4 byte header
- DTLS based PSK, RPK and Certificate security
- Subset of MIME types and HTTP response codes
- Built-in discovery
- Optional observation and block transfer
